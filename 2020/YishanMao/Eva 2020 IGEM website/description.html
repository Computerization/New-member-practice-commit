                                <p>Prostate Cancer is the abnormal propagation of cells in the prostate, a gland located below the bladder, above the penis, and produces the seminal fluid. This disease is the third leading cause of all men's cancer deaths.[1] New cases increase with an increment of 0.66 million each year.[2] </p>
                                <p>Cases of prostate cancer concentrate in North America and Oceania, and Asia has the fewest.[3] Overall, the risk of getting the disease increases with age. While other factors are unified, the incidence of prostate cancer can increase from 4% for these with an age below 30 to 49% for these above 79.[4]</p>
                                <p>Prophase of prostate cancer reveals symptoms like blockage of the bladder neck, difficulty to urinate, or even hematuria. For patients older than 65 years old, dysuria, frequent urge to urinate, and pain from the back is extrusive. As the situation deteriorates, low back pain, lack of urination, symptoms of uremia may also appear due to stress to nerves and ureter.[5]</p>
                                <p>Although only 31,620 out of the 174,650 cases of prostate cancer in 2019 in the US were estimated to die[6], a much smaller number compared to other cancers, once bone metastasis occurs, which is extremely common to happen without apparent signals for this type of cancer, the mortality rate rockets accompanied by anemia, ostealgia, catacalsis, and paraplegia. [7] Prostate Cancer can act as a start for cells to grow abnormally inside patients’ bodies, and as the tipping point is reached by accumulating, infiltrating, and transferring cancer cells, side effects of tumor in different positions follow such. </p>
                                <p>Prostate cancer is when a tumor grows in the prostate, a gland that only appears in male that help supplies prostatic fluid to nourish sperm cell to keep them alive. It often shows no signs in early stages but can slowly turn in to advanced stages and show symptoms like trouble urinating, blood in semen and erectile dysfunction. For now, doctors are still trying to figure out what specifically cause prostate. Present theory is that prostate cancer begins at the mutation of cell as the cancer cell divide and the number of them increases, the accumulation of cancer cell finally forms the tumor. Treatments include observation or active surveillance, surgery, radiation, cryotherapy, hormone therapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapy.<p>
								<p>Prostate cancer at advanced stages can be very dangerous to human. The survival rate of regional prostate cancer in 5 years is fairly high, about 100%, and in 10 years it will decrease to 98%. But with prostate cancer that has spreads to other gland and tissue, the survival rate will be 30% only in 5 year-time. Prostate cancer can also bring complications such as metastasizes. It means that the cancer has spread to other areas such as the bladder or bones. As the data shows, it is unlikely to be cured. Also, men who has prostate cancer has a higher chance in getting a “second cancer”, this include small intestine cancer, soft tissue cancer, bladder cancer, thyroid cancer, thymus cancer and Melanoma of the skin.<p>
								<p>Nowadays, we have several ways to diagnose prostate cancer, including DRE, t-PSA、f-PSA/t-PSA, TRUS and MRI.<p>
								<h3>DRE:</h3>
                                <p>DRE (digital rectal examination) is a traditional and important way to diagnose the prostate cancer, since the prostate is close to the front of the rectum. Under normal conditions, the prostate touched by digital rectal examination is about 4cm×3cm in size, with soft texture, smooth surface. When suffering from the prostate cancer, the prostate surface will be found to be unsmooth during digital rectal examination, and sometimes protruding tumor nodules can be touched. If the tumor volume is large, even the whole prostate texture will become very hard, like stones. Quickly as other detections develop, DRE still keep its necessity. DRE is easy to operate, and can usually find relatively large prostate cancer nodules. Also, DRE by primary care clinicians has some evidence to show discrimination between benign and malignant conditions affecting the prostate.[8] </p>
                                <p>However, it has some inevitable problems. Firstly, small lesions located on both sides of the periprostatic belt or near the transitional zone are not easy to be touched, and are subjective and insensitive to diagnosis. Secondly, some men felt a loss of personal dignity after undergoing the invasive procedure of screening, which makes them afraid of DRE.[9] 
                                <p>In conclusion, the specificity of DRE is high, but the sensitivity is poor.[10]<p>
								<h3>Serum PSA:</h3>
                                <p>Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing of men at normal risk of prostate cancer is one of the most contested issues in cancer screening. There is no formal screening program, but testing is common - arguably a practice that ran ahead of the evidence. Detection of serum P SA and F-PSA/PSA. In the morning, the patient’s venous blood was 2 ml on an empty stomach, and the blood was separated for measurement and collected.  Avoid digital examination, catheterization, and prostate puncture before specimens. Use The ACCESS fully automatic particle chemistry development of American Beckman The photo immunoassay system and the set of calibration solutions and reagents are PSA and free P SA are tested. According to the free and total PSA calculates the ratio of f～PSA/t-P SA.</p>
                                <p>Human Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) is a 33 kD a single Glycoprotein, secreted by prostate epithelial cells, can make seminal plasma liquefied Function. In recent years, PSA has become the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of prostate cancer. One of the most valuable indicators in the evaluation is widely used in clinical practice. But PSA only has the specificity of prostate tissue and does not have prostate cancer. Specificity, current prostatic hyperplasia, acute urinary retention, prostatitis, rectum Digital examination, cystoscopy, ejaculation, or rubbing will also cause blood serum The P SA has risen significantly. Currently, it is generally accepted as t-P SA is less than 4 ng/ml is the standard threshold of normal serum, between 4-10 ng/ml is Gray area, greater than 10 ng/m l can assist clinical diagnosis of prostate cancer Meaning. This study found that when t-P SA was diagnosed at 9.5 ng/ml. At the critical point, its detection sensitivity and specificity are 67.7% and 58.5%. 8. The A U C value can reach 0.659, indicating the diagnosis of prostate cancer The efficiency is not high. This is also in line with the recent articles reported], Zhang Lei, etc. When screening patients with prostate cancer in Beijing, it was found that t—PSA's sensitivity and specificity for detecting prostate cancer patients are only. They are 69.0 and 51.8 respectively. In view of the t-P SA test separately The efficiency is not high, so it is urgent to find more effective indicators to improve Diagnosis rate of prostate cancer.
                                <p>Prostate-Specific Antigen screening (PSA screening) has long been criticized because of its inaccuracy. The only significant positive attributes of PSA screening is the ease at which it can be performed (PSA screening only requires a blood sample from the patient in addition to subsequent lab analysis)[11], and that it can increase diagnosis rate.[12] Elevation of serum PSA levels can be attributed to a range of different physiological conditions, for example benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), prostatitis, urinary retention, or instrumentation[13]. Therefore, relying only on serum total PSA (t-PSA) levels to diagnose prostate cancer can lead to false positive or even false negative cases[14], and is thus flawed to some extent. The false-positive results can lead to over-diagnosis, over-treatment, and anxiety of the patient, and may be followed by a prostate biopsy[15], a procedure with an associated risk of infection of 0.9% and mortality rate of 0.1%.[16]The accuracy of PSA screening can be improved by considering free-to-total serum PSA ratio (f-PSA/t-PSA), based on the fact that the ratio of f-PSA to t-PSA decreases in men with prostate cancer. Despite efforts to improve PSA screening accuracy, the USPSTF decided that the risks involved in PSA screening are greater than its potential benefits, and thus recommended against PSA testing in men across all ages.[17]<p>                            
								<h3>TRUS & MRI:</h3>
								<p>TRUS:<p>
								<p>Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) is a method of transrectal ultrasound examination, which is also the most commonly used method to examine the prostate cancer (PCa). At present, transrectal ultrasound examination is widely used to examine prostatic hyperplasia, prostatitis, prostate cancer and rectal lesions. Because the ultrasound probe can be directly placed on the prostate to show the clear image of small lesions, especially micro cancer. <p>
								<p>MRI:<p>
								<p>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a kind of tomography, which uses the phenomenon of magnetic resonance to obtain electromagnetic signal from human body and reconstruct human body information. It can obtain sectional images in any direction, three-dimensional volume images, and even four-dimensional images of spatial spectral distribution. Pelvic MRI can show the lesions of uterus, ovary, bladder, prostate and seminal vesicle. Because endometrium and myometrium can be directly seen through MRI, this technology is in great value of qualitative diagnosis and localization of prostate lesions.<p>
								<p>MP-MRI:<p>
								<p>Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MP-MRI) is a triage test that may allow males to avoid a quarter of unnecessary TRUS-biopsy test. MP-MRI is able to reduce overdiagnosis of clinically insignificant prostate cancer as well as improve detection and accuracy of clinically significant prostate cancer.<p>
								<p>Currently, most men who have prostate cancer need to undergo transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (TRUS-biopsy). However, this method can cause side-effects including bleeding, pain, and infection. Therefore, another method called Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MP-MRI) appeared. MRI is used as an initial test prior to the first prostate biopsy. This may:<p>
								<p>(1) reduce the proportion of men having unnecessary biopsies;<p>
								<p>(2) improve the detection of CS prostate cancer; and<p>
								<p>(3) increase the cost-effectiveness of the prostate cancer diagnostic and therapeutic pathway.[18]<p>
								<p>Using MRI has even more benefits than the 3 discussed above. According to the report published by Schoots IG and other scientists, MRI-TBx have a higher rate of detecting significant prostate cancer and a lower rate of detection of insignificant prostate cancer compared with TRUS-Bx.[19]<p>
								<p>However, there are also research findings that don’t support the conclusion that MRI is better than TRUS. A team’s research showed that using TRUS-Bx was better than MRI-TBx for the diagnosis of PCa in PI-RADS 3. TRUS-Bx is also better than MRI-TBx for detecting non-csPCa in PI-RADS 4 or 5.[20]<p>
